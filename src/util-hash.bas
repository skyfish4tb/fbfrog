'' Generic hash table (open addressing/closed hashing), based on GCC's libcpp's
'' hash table.
''
'' Note: No deletions possible due to the collision resolution adding duplicates
'' to other entries in the table, instead of adding to the same bucket.
'' Each duplicate can be reached by following through the chain of steps
'' indicated by hashHash2(), the first free entry reached indicates the end of
'' the chain -- that's where duplicates are inserted. Removing an entry from
'' this chain would cause the following entries to become unreachable/lost,
'' as the free item in the middle would appear as the end of the chain now.
''
'' If the hash table owns the strings then hashAdd() will duplicate them and
'' then never change them again until hashEnd() which frees them.
